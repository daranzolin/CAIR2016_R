# CAIR2016_R


### Session Description
R is a powerful tool for statistical computing and
graphics. It has, unfortunately, been caricatured as
weird, unforgiving, and applicable only to hardcore
statisticians. The objective of this session is thus
twofold: (1) to demonstrate R's versatility up and
down the data pipeline; and (2) to demonstrate R's
overall accessibility to users who do not have a
computer science background. Towards those ends, I
will narrate a typical R workflow at Scout from start
to finish including scripts, plots, HTML and PDF
reports, and an interactive web application.
